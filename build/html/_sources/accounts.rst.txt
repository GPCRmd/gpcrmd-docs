Reset password
==============

Sometimes the user can forget the account password. For this reason, we have a reset method to reset the password to a new one. As policy of security the GPCRmd team cannot recover the passwords because is a private element for each user. The only thing that we can offer is to reset them to a new and different one.

To access into this process the user need to click on "Forgot your password?" under the credencials of the log in form.

Then the page will ask the email associated with the account that wants to reset the password:

Once, the user introduce the email and click on "Send" a confirm message will show.
