==================
Citate submissions
==================

To cite your simulations in a paper, you have two options (you can use both):

1. **Individual links for each submission**:

   - `<https://www.gpcrmd.org/view/90/>`_
   - `<https://www.gpcrmd.org/view/36/>`_

2. **Publication page**, where all your submissions are collected in a single table using the same **GPCRmd publication code**:

   `<https://www.gpcrmd.org/dynadb/publications/1469/>`_

Additionally, once you have the DOI of your publication, or as soon as it becomes available, include it in **Step 5** of our submission process to ensure a complete and accurate citation.
