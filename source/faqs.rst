* **Question:** How can I create an account in GPCRmd? 
  
  * **Answer:** `GPCRmd account guide <https://gpcrmd-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accounts.html>`_

* **Q:** How can I submit a simulation into GPCRmd? 

  * **A:** `GPCRmd submission guide <https://gpcrmd-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submissions.html>`_

* **Q:** How can I cite my submission/simulation into an article?

  * **A:** `GPCRmd submission citation guide <https://gpcrmd-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/citation.html>`_

* **Q:** How can I share unpublished submissions that are not public with others?

  * **A:** As the owner of the submission, you can share the "Secret submission key" to provide access to the dynamic. For more information, refer to the documentation here: https://gpcrmd-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accounts.html#gpcrmd-account-menu .

* **Q:** I have a format file of trajectory or topology that I can not submit. What can I do? 

  * **A:** Using the program `VMD <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_ the user can load the topology and trajectory and then export the files into format files like .pdb or .xtc. 

* **Q:** I have replicas for each system. Do I need to upload them as separate submissions?

  * **A:** No, you can select and upload all the replicas of the system in a single submission.

* **Q:** Do you provide a service to perform simulations?

  * **A:** GPCRmd is a repository for MD simulations of GPCRs, but we do not offer a simulation service. Instead, we focus on collecting, visualizing, and sharing existing GPCR molecular dynamics data.
  
* **Q:** Why have I not access to some simulations? 

  * **A:** Due to protect the unpublished data and save the integrity of copyright, GPCRmd follow a security protocol that only gives the posibility to the user to share this data by a secret submission key and the dynamic id (see `Secret submission key section <https://gpcrmd-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accounts.html#gpcrmd-account-menu>`_).

* **Q:** As user, if I have closed the submission, why can I not see it public in GPCRmd?

  * **A:** In order to a submission will become published in GPCRmd the data uploaded must follow a process of checking. First, the user must close the submission and will be send it to check process. Next, the GPCRmd will check that the information provided for the user is correct in order to avoid errors. Once, the GPCRmd team decides that everything is correct, checking the data with the user, it send it to the database to be open to the public.
